## How to Work With Gradle
In order to start working with Gradle, you first have to make sure the project contains the following files:
 * gradle.build
 * gradlew
 * gradlew.bat
 * settings.gradle

The basic usage of Gradle is accessed via the following commands:
* Use the `build` task to build (or re-build) the project.
    ```
    $ ./gradlew build
    ```
The compiled files can be found inside the "/build/exe/main" folder.

for further information about Gradle, please take a look at [the Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
