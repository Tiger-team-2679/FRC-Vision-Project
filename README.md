## How to Work With Gradle
In order to  start working with Gradle, first you have to make sure the project contains the following files:
 * gradle.build
 * gradlew
 * gradlew.bat
 * settings.gradle

The basic functionality of Gradle is using the following commands:
* In order to build the code, we will use the build command
    ```
    $ ./gradlew build
    ```
If we want to run the code, the compiled files will be found inside the "/build/exe/main" folder

for further information about Gradle, please take a look at [the Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
