## How to Deploy With Gradle
In order to start working with Gradle, you first have to make sure the project contains the following files:
 * gradle.build
 * gradlew
 * gradlew.bat

We use gradle only for deploy the code into the jetson, by the following command:
*
    ```
    $ ./gradlew jetsonDeploy
    ```

for further information about Gradle, please take a look at [the Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).
